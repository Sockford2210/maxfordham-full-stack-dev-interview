# Question: Web Application Design with Nuxt and NuxtUI

We are currently updating our in-house WebApp from Vue.js 2 to Vue 3. We hope to complete this in 3 months time.
As part of this, we have decided to use Nuxt as the framework for the site, including the NuxtUI component library.

1. Starting from this point, please describe your approach to the following design:

> A single-page application featuring a Navigation Sidebar with a Site Menu; a Header with a User Avatar and Menu; all surrounding the main content.

```{note}
For this exercise, we are not concerned with code, but rather what considerations you would have for the design based on the information about the listed resources. Give some examples of how you would structure such an application.
```
